<h2>Introduction to the College</h2>




<p><strong>Innovation and Impact</strong></p>




<p>There are many reasons Berkeley Engineering is ranked among the top three engineering schools in the world: we offer a dynamic, interdisciplinary, hands-on education; we challenge conventional thinking and value creativity and imagination; and our students and faculty are driven by social commitment and want to change the world. In the classroom, the research lab or in the design studio, our community is both welcoming and tightly knit. Whether they are pursuing groundbreaking research or teaching students, our faculty members are engaged and accessible. We are a village of entrepreneurs and collaborators within the big city of a renowned public university. At Berkeley Engineering, we’re making a world of difference.</p>

				<a name="ucandcampusrequirementstext"></a><h2>UC and Campus Requirements</h2><h3>University of California Requirements</h3>
<p><a href="/2016-17/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a>
</p>

<p>All students who enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="/2016-17/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/american-history-institutions-requirements/">American History and American Institutions</a>
</p>

<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<h3>Campus Requirement</h3>
<p><a href="/2016-17/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a>
</p>

<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity and culture in the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American Culture.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Humanities and Social Sciences Requirement</h3>
<p>To promote a rich and varied educational experience outside of the technical requirements for each major, the College of Engineering has a six-course <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences">Humanities and Social Sciences breadth requirement</a>
, which must be completed to graduate. This requirement, built into all the Engineering programs of study, includes two reading and composition courses (R &amp; C), and four additional courses, within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. Follow these guidelines to fulfill this requirement:</p>

<ol style="margin-left:40px">
	<li>Complete a minimum of six courses.</li>
	<li>Courses must be a minimum of 3 semester units (or 4 quarter units).</li>
	<li>Two of the six courses must fulfill the College's Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) requirement. These courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="/2016-17/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses </a>
that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </li>

	<li>The four additional courses must be chosen within College of Engineering guidelines from the H/SS lists (see below). These courses may be taken on a Passed/Not Passed Basis (P/NP).</li>
	<li>Two of the six courses must be upper division (courses numbered 100-196).</li>
	<li>One of the six courses must satisfy the campus American Cultures requirement. For detailed lists of courses that fulfill American Cultures requirements, visit the <a href="/2016-17/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures </a>
page. </li>

	<li>A maximum of two exams (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-Level) may be used toward completion of the H/SS requirement. View <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-guide/exams-ap-ib-level-and-transfer-credit-information">the list of exams</a>
 that can be applied toward H/SS requirements.</li>

	<li>Courses may fulfill multiple categories. For example, if you complete City and Regional Planning 118AC that would satisfy the American Cultures requirement and one upper division H/SS requirement.</li>
	<li>No courses offered by any Engineering department other than BIOE 100, COMPSCI C79, ENGIN 125, 157AC, ME 191K and ME 191AC may be used to complete H/SS requirements.</li>
	<li>Foreign language courses may be used to complete H/SS requirements. View <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/approved-foreign-language-courses/">the list of language options</a>
.</li>

	<li>Courses numbered 97, 98, 99, or above 196 may not be used to complete any H/SS requirement.</li>
	<li>The College of Engineering uses modified versions of five of the College of Letters and Science (L&amp;S) breadth requirements lists to provide options to our students for completing the H/SS requirement.
