<h3>University of California Requirements</h3>
<p><a href="/2016-17/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a>
</p>

<p>All students who will enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="/2016-17/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/american-history-institutions-requirement/">American History and American Institutions</a>
</p>

<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<h3>Campus Requirement</h3>
<p><a href="/2016-17/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a>
</p>

<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate.

<h3>Residence Requirements</h3>
<p>For units to be considered in &quot;residence,&quot; students must be registered in courses on the Berkeley campus as a student in the College of Letters and Science. Most students automatically fulfill the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to meet a College Adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<p>Note: Courses taken through UC Extension do not count toward residence.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After becoming a senior (with 90 semester units earned toward the B.A. degree), students must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence in at least two semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units. Intercampus Visitor, EAP, and UC Berkeley-Washington Program (UCDC) units are excluded.</p>
<p>Students may use a Berkeley summer session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that they successfully complete 6 units of course work in the Summer Session and that they have been enrolled previously in the College.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP) or the UC Berkeley-Washington Program (UCDC) may meet a Modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 (excluding EAP) of their final 60 semester units in residence. At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after the completion of 90 units.</p>
<h3>Upper Division Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Students must complete in residence a minimum of 18 units of upper division courses (excluding EAP units), 12 of which must satisfy the requirements for their major.</p>

<breadthrequirementstext>
<![CDATA[
<p><span>The undergraduate breadth requirements provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and provides context that prepares Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</span></p>
<h3><span>Guidelines for Seven-Course Breadth</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li>No course may be used to fulfill more than one breadth category.</li>
	<li>Breadth courses may be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required) or on a <em>Passed/Not Passed</em> basis.</li>
	<li>Beginning fall 2015, 2 unit courses <strong>will not</strong> be accepted for breadth.</li>
	<li>No more than two courses from any one academic department may be used to satisfy breadth requirements (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">L&amp;S Discovery Courses</a>
 exempt). Cross-listed courses are counted under every sponsoring department.</li>

	<li>Courses fulfilling American History &amp; Institutions, American Cultures, or requirements in the major program may also be applied to the Seven-Course Breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>The following cannot be applied to the Seven-Course Breadth:
	<ul>
		<li>Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate. </li>
		<li>Courses numbered 84*, 97, 98, 99, and those 190 and above</li>
		<li>Courses fulfilling the Reading and Composition, Quantitative Reasoning, or Foreign Language requirements</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Courses numbered 84 offered prior to spring 2012 may be eligible for breadth credit. Visit <a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/breadth84note.html" target="_blank">http://fss.berkeley.edu/breadth84note.html</a>
 for a list of these courses.</li>

	<li>Current students may only select from Courses Approved to Meet the Seven-Course Breadth Requirement list to satisfy breadth</li>
</ul>

<h3>Satisfying the Seven Course Breadth Requirement with Transfer Work</h3>
<ul>
	<li>For courses from California community colleges, read <a href="http://www.assist.org/" target="_blank">ASSIST</a>
. *Note: <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/transfer/requirements/additional-requirements/igetc/index.html" target="_blank">IGETC certification</a>
 from a California community college or a letter of reciprocity from a UC campus satisfies the Seven-Course Breadth requirement (and all other L&amp;S breadth requirements).*</li>

	<li>Successful completion (with a letter grade of C- or better or a Passed grade) of equivalent transferable courses at an accredited college will satisfy the requirement.</li>
	<li>For courses from other institutions, check with the L&amp;S Evaluation Unit at 510-642-7391. (Course descriptions and syllabi may be required to make a breadth determination.)</li>

<h3>Welcome to L&amp;S Undergraduate Advising!</h3>
<p>The Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/about-us/ls-office-undergraduate-advising-staff" target="_blank">staff</a>
 of highly skilled and experienced College Advisers, is here to help students make the best choices for their academic career and get the most out of their time at Berkeley. </p>

<h3><span>Declaring a Major</span></h3>
<p>Students in L&amp;S must declare a major before the first semester of their junior year (for transfer students, before the beginning of the second semester at Berkeley). Those who do not declare by that time will be subject to a registration block, so it is imperative to declare on time. There are other good reasons to declare as soon as students are ready. As a declared student, students will be given higher priority to enroll in courses in their major department, and they will have greater access to departmental advising and other departmental resources.</p>
<p>Once you are eligible to declare, print a copy of the <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/advmajordeclaration.pdf" target="_blank">Major Declaration</a>
  and have it signed by the adviser for the chosen major. At the meeting with the departmental adviser, it is helpful (and for some majors, required) to bring an updated copy of the student's Berkeley transcript and copies of transcripts for courses taken at other institutions. Be sure to check in with your intended major early, as criteria to declare can vary greatly.</p>

<h3>Checking Individual Progress Toward Degree</h3>
<p>Students who wish to check their progress should meet with a College Adviser.</p>

<h3><a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Freshman and Sophomore Seminars</a>
</h3>

<p>Freshman and Sophomore Seminars arose from the conviction that early intellectual contact with faculty members would greatly enhance the undergraduate experience at Berkeley. Professors from nearly every campus department join together each semester to offer an impressive array of seminars. The courses numbered 24 bear one unit of credit; they are limited to 15 students, and freshmen are given priority for enrollment. The courses numbered 84 bear one or two units of credit; they are limited to 15 sophomores. The courses numbered 39A-39Z are limited to 25 freshmen and sophomores. Seminars, which emphasize interaction and discussion, provide a counterpoint to the learning experience in Berkeley's large lecture halls. These seminars also offer lower-division students an unprecedented opportunity to explore a wide range of majors and even fields of study usually reserved for graduate students. Browsing through this <em>Guide,</em> students will find lower division seminars sponsored by Letters and Science departments as well as by the professional schools and colleges. Descriptions of all the seminars scheduled for the upcoming semester can be found in time for course enrollment on the <a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Freshman and Sophomore program's website</a>
 that also contains other useful information and features for undergraduates. For additional information regarding the Freshman and Sophomore Seminars, contact the program office at 231 Evans Hall, 510-642-8378.</p>
