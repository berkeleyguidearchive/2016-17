<h2><span>Overview</span></h2>
<div class="inner">
<p>Development Studies is administered by the International &amp; Area Studies Academic Program (IAS). The IAS provides an interdisciplinary approach to the study of international and global issues. Comprised of six <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/node/64" target="_blank">undergraduate majors</a>
 and three <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/node/8" target="_blank">graduate degree programs</a>
, IAS is a unique intellectual domain. At a historical moment of unprecedented interconnectedness, IAS trains students in the knowledge and skills that are fundamental components of global citizenship and practice. IAS has strategically adopted an interdisciplinary approach to such training, with the belief that no single discipline can prepare students in the depth and breadth necessary for a complex and reflexive understanding of world history and contemporary globalization. Accordingly, IAS offers interdisciplinary core courses in fields such as Political Economy, Development Studies, and Peace &amp; Conflict Studies, and then incorporates courses offered through many other departments, offering students a rigorous, but flexible, curriculum which recognizes that learning takes place both inside and outside the classroom.</p>

<p>The Development Studies major focuses on social transformation or change. The problems of social transformation are urgent, massive, complex, and often transcend the boundaries of conventional academic disciplines.</p>
