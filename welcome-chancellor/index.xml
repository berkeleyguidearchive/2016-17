 Welcome students, members and friends of the UC Berkeley community,</p>

<p>Formerly known as the General Catalog, the Berkeley Academic Guide is your gateway to UC Berkeley’s incredible array of academic offerings for students and scholars.</p>
<p>The Guide is a great way to explore possible areas of study, learn about the members of our world-class faculty, and access a wide range of opportunities, and resources available to Berkeley students. The Guide also provides information about degree requirements, course descriptions and a broad range of academic options as you chart your course through the curriculum.</p>
<p>Waiting for you is an unsurpassed educational experience as a member of a unique and incredibly diverse community of students, faculty, researchers, staff and alumni. The energy and excitement that is produced, day in and day out, by this coming together of people with different perspectives, talents and areas of expertise is hard to capture in words, and even harder to resist.  </p>
<p>If you are someone who has little use for conventional wisdom or the status quo, and want to reach further in order to improve the world we live in...you have come to the right place.</p>
<p>Welcome to Berkeley and Go Bears!</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br/>
Chancellor Nicholas B. Dirks</p>
