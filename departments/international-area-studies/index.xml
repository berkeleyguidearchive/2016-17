<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The International and Area Studies Academic Program (IAS) provides an interdisciplinary approach to the study of international and global issues. Comprised of six undergraduate majors and three graduate degree programs, IAS is a unique intellectual domain. At a historical moment of unprecedented interconnectedness, IAS trains students in the knowledge and skills that are fundamental components of global citizenship and practice. IAS has strategically adopted an interdisciplinary approach to such training with the belief that no single discipline can prepare students in the depth and breadth necessary for a complex and reflexive understanding of world history and contemporary globalization. Accordingly, IAS offers interdisciplinary core<a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/node/3" target="_blank"> courses</a>
 in fields such as political economy, development studies, and peace and conflict studies. Then, IAS incorporates courses offered through many other departments, offering students a rigorous but flexible curriculum which recognizes that learning takes place both inside and outside the classroom.</p>

<h3>Concurrent Master's Degree</h3>
<p>The MA in International and Area Studies (IAS) is a two-year concurrent master's program. It is an interdisciplinary program designed to complement the graduate degree work by providing the fundamentals of contemporary international issues and/or detailed knowledge on particular world regions or countries. The MA in International and Area Studies provides wide flexibility in crafting an individual interdisciplinary program complementing or enhancing the primary area of graduate study. Students tailor the content of their programs within a defined framework to suit their interests. Specific course work is chosen in consultation with a faculty adviser.</p>
<p>This program is available only to students who are currently registered in an UC Berkeley graduate program. For further information, visit the <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">program's website</a>

This course is designed to expose both precollege and college level students to the issues, challenges, and skills needed to negotiate the global economic, social, political, and physical environment. It is an innovative and integrated approach to global studies pedagogy and leadership development. Students will be exposed to and trained in the fundamental concepts of globalization, global inequality</span><span class="deschide">, and global change. In addition to the general education provided by the core module of the course, each year the course will tackle a different theme that amplifies key issues in global studies. The course will link theory and analysis to the transformative forms of practice. Students will work in teams on a real-world project related to the course theme, thus developing valuable leadership skills. The faculty coordinator will be joined by experts both from within and outside the institution to bring to students lectures, presentations, experiential opportunities, workshops, and group projects to explore the concept of leadership, issues of human poverty, human rights, social justice, urban planning for sustainable growth, and development.</span><br/>

The course will start with a brief introduction and evaluation of the scientific aspects behind climate change. Economic models will be developed to analyze the impacts of climate change and provide and critique existing and proposed policy tools. Specific topics studied are impacts on water resources and agriculture, economic evaluation of impacts, optimal control of greenhouse gases, benefit cost analysis, international treaty formation</span><span class="deschide">, discounting, uncertainty, irreversibility, and extreme events.</span><br/>

This course is a self-contained introduction to the economics of climate change. Climate change is caused by a large variety of economic activities, and many of its impacts will have economic consequences. Economists have studied climate change for more than two decades, and economic arguments are often powerful in policy decisions. The course will familiarize students with these arguments and equip them with the tools to participate in discussions of climate</span><span class="deschide"> change policy through an economic lens.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives  Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course will start with a brief review of the science of climate change, discuss scenarios of economic growth and the greenhouse gas emissions caused by economic activities and investigate various emission reduction opportunities and their economic costs. A significant amount of time will be spent on studying the impacts of climate change, their economic evaluation and how adaptation can lower the costs of climate damages.<br/>
<br/>We will then study various theoretical frameworks economists have developed that answer the question how estimates about the costs and benefits of climate policy can be combined to find “good” climate policies. We then study three more specialized topics that turn out to be of great importance when analyzing climate change policy: first, how do we compare costs and benefits of generations that live many centuries apart? Second, how do we design climate policy when our projections of both the costs and the benefits of climate policy are highly uncertain? And third, how can equity considerations be accounted for in an economic assessment of climate change policy? The course will close with a look at international cooperation on climate policy and why it has been so difficult to agree on effective treatises that implement climate change policy.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will also have gained insight into the practical aspects of modeling the economics of climate change by building a simple integrated assessment model in Excel. They will be able to use that model to do simple analysis of climate change policy themselves.<br/>
Students will be familiar with the tools economists use to analyze climate change policy. They will have studied empirical estimates of the costs and benefits of climate policy and have an understanding of the analytical issues that drive research on the economics of climate change.</p></div>

Portuguese immigrants have exerted a strong imprint on the landscape and culture of California and other regions of North America, and the study of this diaspora continues to be a lively topic of scholarly research.

The strong parallels</span><span class="deschide"> between the Mediterranean-climate landscapes of Portugal and California provide excellent opportunities for comparative studies in environment and human adaptations in environment.
