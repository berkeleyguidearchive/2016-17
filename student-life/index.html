				<a name="theucberkeleystorytext"></a><h2>The UC Berkeley Story</h2><p>Founded in the wake of the gold rush by leaders of the newly established 31st state, the University of California's flagship campus at Berkeley has become one of the preeminent universities in the world. Its early guiding lights, charged with providing education (both &quot;practical&quot; and &quot;classical&quot;) for the state's people, gradually established a distinguished faculty (with 22 Nobel laureates to date), a stellar research library, and more than 170 academic departments and programs.</p>
<p>This California institution became a catalyst of economic growth and social innovation — the place where vitamin E was discovered, a lost Scarlatti opera found, the flu virus identified, and the nation's first no-fault divorce law drafted. Scholars at Berkeley have conducted groundbreaking research on urban street gangs and on basic human nutritional requirements, identified why wartime supply ships were failing at sea, invented technologies to build faster and cheaper computer chips, and imaged the infant universe.</p>
<p>In recognition of broad and deep excellence, respected sources have repeatedly ranked UC Berkeley at or near the top in fields ranging from engineering and the &quot;hard&quot; sciences to the social sciences, arts, and humanities. Case in point: A National Research Council analysis of U.S. universities concluded that UC Berkeley has the largest number of highly ranked graduate programs in the country. It ranked doctoral programs within a range (such as between 1st and 5th) and found that 48 out of 52 Berkeley programs assessed ranked within the top 10 nationally.</p>
<p>In accordance with UC's &quot;public&quot; character, the university has long served talented individuals regardless of means. As early as 1897, financial aid was available for &quot;needy and deserving&quot; students. More than a century later, UC Berkeley combines outstanding teaching and research programs with broad access for students of all means — educating more federal Pell Grant recipients from low-income families than all eight Ivy League universities combined. Seventeen percent of UC Berkeley freshmen are the first in their families to attend college.</p>

				<a name="universityofcaliforniatext"></a><h2>The University of California</h2><p>The University of California is composed of 10 campuses, each with a distinctive character. The San Francisco campus was added to the University in 1873, Davis began classes in 1909, the Los Angeles campus in 1919, Riverside in 1954, Santa Barbara in 1958, San Diego in 1960, and Santa Cruz and Irvine in 1965. UC Merced opened as UC’s 10th campus in fall 2005. The University has five law schools, five medical schools, and schools of architecture, business administration, education, engineering, and many others.</p>
<p>UC campuses have a full-time faculty of about 8,800, and the total enrollment is about 220,000 students, most of them California residents. Nearly 25 percent are graduate students. Some 480 laboratories, extension centers, and research and field stations strengthen teaching and research while providing public service to California and the country.</p>

				<a name="organizationandadministrationtext"></a><h2>Organization and Administration</h2><p>Under the State Constitution, the government of the University is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The regents appoint the president of the University, and with the president’s advice, appoint the chancellors, directors of major laboratories, provosts, and deans who administer the affairs of the individual campuses and other divisions of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by the regents to the Academic Senate, which determines academic policy for the University as a whole.</p>
<p>The Board of Regents includes seven ex-officio board members and 18 members who are appointed by the governor for 12-year terms after consultation with an advisory committee. In addition, the regents appoint a student regent for a one-year term as a voting board member with full rights of participation. The chair and vice chair of the Academic Council serve as faculty representatives to the board and participate fully in all discussions. A constitutional amendment provides that “Regents shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, cultural, and social diversity of the State, including ethnic minorities and women.” They shall have “full powers of organization and government, subject only to such legislative controls as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the endowments of the University and the security of its funds.”</p>
<p>The president is executive head of the ten-campus University system. The Office of the President, located in Oakland, is the University’s central administrative headquarters. There are eight divisions—Academic Affairs, Agriculture and Natural Resources, Business Operations, External Relations, Finance, General Counsel, Health Sciences and Services, and Laboratory Management. The Office of the President performs administrative functions for the University as a whole and supports all campus operations.</p>
<p>Each of the campuses has a chancellor as its chief administrative officer. The chancellor is responsible for the organization and operation of the campus, including academic, student, and business affairs. For the names of University regents, officers, and chancellors, see the <a href="/2016-17/student-life/#officersofadministrationtext">Officers of Administration tab. </a>
</p>

<p>The Academic Senate, consisting of faculty and certain other teaching titles, determines the conditions for admission and degrees, subject to the approval of the Regents; authorizes and supervises courses and curricula; and advises the University administration on the important matters of faculty appointments and promotions and budgets.</p>
<p>Students participate in policy making at both the campus and Universitywide levels.</p>
