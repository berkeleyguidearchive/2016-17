Provides a command of the basic structures of standard spoken Cambodian and tools for reading and writing elementary texts. Through use of computer-based materials, a textbook, and communicative practice, students gain a foundation in &quot;survival&quot; spoken Khmer. This involves memorization of question and answer exchanges in Khmer which students are likely to encounter in modern Cambodia.</span><span class="deschide"> Topics include greetings, speaking to teachers and elders and discussing language learning, talking about family and personal history, and food. Students learn the Khmer alphabet and important sight-words and to read and write simple sentences on everyday topics. Intended for non-native speakers of Khmer with no oral or aural comprehension in the language. Students will also learn important basic behaviors and courtesies necessary for smooth interaction in Khmer society and culture.</span><br />

Students complete their study of everyday standard Khmer to a &quot;survival&quot; level. While the memorization of vocabulary and common personal exchanges practiced in 1A will make up the majority of material studied, students will have some opportunity to learn to improvise and talk about personal work and research interests in Khmer. Topics include transportation and directions,</span><span class="deschide"> the world of work, religion, health, and conducting daily life in Cambodia. Students learn to read simple authentic texts such as folk tales, personal letters, forms, and roadside signs. Students continue their study of culturally appropriate behavior in the context of Khmer culture, including notions of &quot;saving face&quot; and maintaining social harmony, and how these are expressed in both spoken language and in one's actions.</span><br />

Non-native speakers who have completed Beginning Khmer will build spoken proficiency with emphasis on everyday &quot;storytelling&quot; and the expression of emotions, feelings, and opinions. Students will gain experience reading progressively difficult authentic Khmer texts, including folk tales and newspaper articles. Native speakers with family exposure to Khmer will be introduced to the</span><span class="deschide"> writing system. They will quickly &quot;catch up&quot; with non-native classmates who have studied the writing system before. All students will study important patterns and structures in Khmer grammar and morphology, and gain a foundation in formal spoken Khmer, express opinions and positions, form arguments, and learn to discuss a variety of topics with educated Khmer speakers. These include Khmer religion, village culture, news, and advertising.</span><br />

Students learn to read roadside signs, scholarly articles, and an entire Khmer novel. Topics include current events in Cambodia, Cambodian history and politics, and a basic overview of traditional Khmer literature. Much of this study will be accomplished by working on projects in groups with other students. One such project will involve the preparation and performance of a play based</span><span class="deschide"> on sections of the modern Khmer novel students read in this course. All students will design and carry out an independent research project on the topic of their choice (which will account for 30% of the final grade), and present their research at the end of the second semester to an audience of their peers, entirely in Khmer.</span><br />

This course continues the themes and goals of 100B. Students will focus on the same broad topics covered in Intermediate Khmer--religion, traditional culture, and the language of public information (news and advertising)--but they will learn more advanced vocabulary and grammatical structures necessary for the discussion of these topics with educated native speakers, and read more advanced</span><span class="deschide"> texts dealing with these topics than the Intermediate students. Additional material beyond the Intermediate curriculum includes reading and analyzing historical folk tales, learning to discuss the rice-farming cycle, and acquiring the tools to discuss research and &quot;development&quot; work in Cambodia at a sophisticated level.</span><br />

Students will read advanced texts dealing with the topics of politics and history. They will also gain exposure to traditional verse texts, and read, discuss, and undertake group projects based on a variety of modern Khmer short stories. As in the case with Intermediate Khmer, students will also undertake substantial independent study, culminating in a final oral presentation. However</span><span class="deschide">, the standard by which both written and oral material will be judged will be much higher for Advanced students. Special attention will be paid to formal speaking style and advanced grammatical structures in Khmer for all students, and colloquial spoken expression for non-native speakers.</span><br />
