This course will teach anyone how to start to be a designer, not just of drawings and objects, but also buildings, landscapes, and urban spaces. And not just in isolation, but in the complex web of ecological and man-made systems which makes up our shifting environment. You will take from the course first-hand experience of drawing, measuring, and design — which form the basis of the professions of architecture, landscape architecture</span><span class="deschide">, and urban planning— and which culminate in a final design project in the course. The course is open to all undergraduate students.</span><br />

The Summer [IN]STITUTE consists of four cohorts, each an introductory course for participants with no previous experience in environmental design: [IN]ARCH, [IN]ARCH ADV, [IN]CITY and [IN]LAND. Institute participants explore the methods and theories of the environmental design disciplines, experience the culture of design and planning studios, connect to faculty and practitioners</span><span class="deschide">, and build a portfolio for graduate school application. Each program includes a lecture series, a design or planning studio, a media seminar, and site visits.

This study of cities is more important than ever; for the first time in history more people live in urban than rural areas, and cities will account for all of the world's population growth for at least the next half-century. We will explore the challenges facing global cities in the 21st Century and expose students to some of the key texts, theories, and methods of inquiry that shape the built environment, from the human scale of home and</span><span class="deschide"> community to the regional scale of the megacity.</span><br />

Guided by UC Berkeley faculty, Bay Area urbanists, designers, makers, and entrepreneurs, Disc* students learn how to confront the most pressing challenges of global urbanization using innovative people-centered design. Through design and digital fabrication studio sessions, lectures and talks, demos and workshops, field work and site visits, students have the opportunity to develop</span><span class="deschide"> and test their own creative ideas while working with some of the most forward-thinking researchers and practitioners from the Bay Area design community. Disc* graduates have a strong understanding of the present and future of global urbanization processes and a broad toolkit with which to tackle its most urgent demands.</span><br />

What is the social art of architecture in America? What was it historically, where is it now, where is it going--and why should you care? In this course, we will explore contemporary and historic attempts to confront social needs through themes: Design by Professionals (Architects, City Planners, Urban Designers, Sociologists, Philosophers, Philanthropists), and Design by Laypeople (Squatters, Intentional Communities, Do It Yourself).
