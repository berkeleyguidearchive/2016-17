This course is designed to introduce mid-career executives to three things: a typology of “kinds of problems” that confront those leading organizations; a sampling of major problems confronting leaders in the next decades; and a sampling of solutions to problems confronting leaders. It introduces the rest of the Berkeley MPA summer core program with examples of the kinds of problems that modern leaders must confront and the kinds of solutions that must be devised.</span><span class="deschide"> The course features at least one article or book by a GSPP faculty member in each session except the last.</span><br/>

The objective of this course is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of ethical arguments in the process and substance of policymaking. Those who seek to govern well inescapably confront questions of value in their political, professional and personal choices.
