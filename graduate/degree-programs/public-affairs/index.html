				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p><span class="s1">Designed for mid-career professionals in the public, private and non-profit sectors, the MPA curriculum focuses on economic analysis, management, strategic thinking, ethical leadership, and negotiations.</span> Students enjoy personal attention in small classes, and join a network of professionals and executives leading the charge to shape government, business and non-profits. </p>
<p>Classes are taught by top faculty, researchers and practitioners who are on the leading edge of today's most pressing public policy issues: climate change, energy, education, poverty, and the political process.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the program is a ten-week summer suite of classes offered in the intimate setting of the Goldman School, the top-ranked public policy analysis school in the United States, which can be completed in one summer, or split over two consecutive summers*.​</p>
<p>During the fall and spring semesters, students complete the program by taking courses in-person or online. </p>
<p>Applying the skills of policy analysis and leadership learned throughout the program, students complete a Capstone Project of their own design. </p>
<p>The collaborative structure of the MPA program facilitates a space for sharing of expertise and worldviews that not only enriches the academic experience, but also forges bonds that make your network as deep as it is wide.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/programs/masters-of-public-affairs-mpa" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3>Admission to the University</h3>
<h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4>
<p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li>
	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li>
	<li>If the applicant comes from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li>
	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4>
<p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p>
<p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p>
<p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p>
<p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li>
	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p>
<h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Please click <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/programs/masters-of-public-affairs-mpa/applying-for-the-mpa/application-criteria​" target="_blank">here</a>
 for our application requirements.</span>
</p>

<h3>Admission to the Program</h3>
<h4>Curriculum Vitae (CV) or Resume</h4>
<p>We are interested in learning about your work and experiential background. Please upload your most current resume or curriculum vitae. If applicable, please also include honors, awards, publications, presentations, languages spoken, and associations you belong to. The admissions committee prefers to receive chronological resumes of 1-2 pages in length.</p>
<h4>Essays</h4>
<p>Applicants are required to complete two essays.</p>
<h5>Statement of Purpose</h5>
<p>Our essay question was created to provoke honest, thoughtful responses to help us get to know you. The admissions committee is interested in learning how your professional or other experiences and achievements equip you and motivate you to enroll in the Berkeley MPA. We are especially interested in understanding both your experience in leading, innovating with, inspiring, or managing other people, and your capacity to take full advantage of an intensive, fast-paced degree program.</p>
<p>You should describe what policy/public service issue(s) you are passionate about that motivates you to make an impact on the world. How have these interests shaped your short-and long-term career goals, and how will the Berkeley MPA enable you to build on your prior professional experience and achieve these goals?</p>
<h5>Personal History Statement</h5>
<p>The personal statement should give concrete evidence of your promise as a member of the academic community, giving the admissions committee an image of you as a person.</p>
<p>This is also where you represent your potential to bring to your academic career a critical perspective rooted in a non-traditional educational background, or your understanding of the experiences of groups historically under-represented in higher education and your commitment to increase participation by a diverse population in higher education.</p>
<h4>Two Letters of Recommendation</h4>
<p>Letters of recommendation provide the admissions committee with third party, qualitative accounts of your potential for leadership and management.  </p>
<p>We strongly prefer that both letters of recommendation come from a current direct supervisor, former direct supervisor, or other individuals with whom you have had significant professional interaction. Please select individuals who know you well and who will take the time to write thorough and thoughtful letters on your behalf. The title or status of those you select is not important. What does matter is how closely your letter writers have worked with you and whether they can attest to your value as an employee, your professional accomplishments, and your personal qualities. We have found the most helpful letters to be recent, relevant, and written specifically for this application. We discourage letters of recommendation from co-workers, subordinates, family, friends, or professors.</p>
<p>You should obtain one of the recommendations from your current direct supervisor. If you do not provide a letter from your current direct supervisor, you are required to include an explanation in the Supplementary Data section of the online application.</p>
<p>You are responsible for ensuring that both required recommendations are submitted prior to the application deadline.</p>
<p>When completing the online application, you will enter the email address of your recommender and click the appropriate box to have the recommender complete an online recommendation. Your recommender receives an automated email with instructions to log in to the online recommendation form.  </p>
<p>We require two letters of recommendation. However, you may submit up to three if you like. The online application will prompt you for three letters of recommendation.  However, if you are only submitting the required two, just enter your own name into the third space.</p>
<h4>GMAT or GRE Exam (optional)</h4>
<p>GRE Scores are not required but may help you to demonstrate skills otherwise not present in your application.  If you wish to submit them, they can be either current or expired.</p>

The objective of this course is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of ethical arguments in the process and substance of policymaking. Those who seek to govern well inescapably confront questions of value in their political, professional and personal choices. The discussion of ethical dilemmas is designed to provoke analytic reflection on the moral challenges and responsibilities for public policymaking in a democracy. The focus is on the many and often competing</span><span class="deschide"> obligations, commitments and values that should guide public actors, as well as on the public principles that guide the design of good public policy.</span><br/>
