				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="Normal1">The Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning offers a professional master's degree, the Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA), and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning.</p>
<h3>Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA)</h3>
<p>The Master of Landscape Architecture degree is a professional degree accredited by the American Society of Landscape Architects. The program offers advanced work in landscape architecture from the scale of detailed form to that of the regional landscape. A core of courses in the department is required of all students, emphasizing the relationship between the design and the environmental planning aspects of the field. This core group forms the foundation for extended coursework in landscape design, urban and community design, and environmental planning.</p>
<h3>Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning</h3>
<p>The doctor of philosophy program is offered for students who wish to pursue advanced scholarly and research work. The program emphasizes the development of theories and methods that underlie the fields of environmental planning or urban design, and the processes of planning and design as they relate to the solution of problems in the natural and urban environment. The PhD degree in Environmental Planning is appropriate for those seeking careers in research and teaching in environmental planning or urban design or in specialized roles in government or professional consultation.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/" target="_blank">See Department Website</a></p>

			<div id="admissionstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3>Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant comes from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. <em>If the applicant is admitted,</em> then <em>official </em>transcripts of all college-level work will be required. Official transcripts must be in sealed envelopes as issued by the school(s) attended. If you have attended Berkeley, upload your unofficial transcript with your application for the departmental initial review. <em>If you are admitted,</em> an official transcript with evidence of degree conferral <em>will not</em> be required.</li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, not the Graduate Division.</li> 	<li><strong>Evidence of English language proficiency:</strong> All applicants from countries or political entities in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to applicants from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement: 	<ul> 		<li>courses in English as a Second Language,</li> 		<li>courses conducted in a language other than English,</li> 		<li>courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</li> 		<li>courses of a non-academic nature.</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:40px">If applicants have previously been denied admission to Berkeley on the basis of their English language proficiency, they must submit new test scores that meet the current minimum from one of the standardized tests.</p> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a> . </p> 
<h3>Admission to the MLA Program</h3>
<p>A bachelor's degree is the minimum requirement for admission to the graduate program. It is recommended that applicants have completed a minimum of one basic course each in the life, earth and social sciences. In addition, graphics and freehand drawing are strongly recommended for applicants with non-design backgrounds.</p>
<h4>MLA 3D: First Professional Degree</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/programs/master-of-landscape-architecture/first-professional-degree">three-year MLA degree</a>
 is the first professional degree accredited by the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA). This degree is for students with non-design backgrounds.</p>

<h4>MLA 2D: Second Professional Degree</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/programs/master-of-landscape-architecture/second-professional-degree">two-year MLA degree</a>
 is the second professional degree, also accredited by ASLA, for those students with first degrees in landscape architecture, architecture, or environmental design.</p>

<h4>MLA EP: Environmental Planning</h4>
<p>The department also offers a <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/programs/master-of-landscape-architecture/environmental-planning">two-year environmental planning program</a>
 leading to the MLA degree for students with a strong background in the environmental sciences or management.</p>

<h3>Admission to the PhD Program</h3>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Admission is granted to a small number of individuals each year. Most applicants will have completed a master's degree before entering. Students with only a bachelor's degree should apply to the MLA program first or otherwise complete an appropriate master's degree before applying.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="doctoraldegreerequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="doctoraldegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Doctoral Degree Requirements</h2><p>The PhD in Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning is offered for students who want to pursue scholarly and research work beyond the master's level. Emphasis in this program is placed on the development of theories and methods that underlie the field of landscape architecture and environmental planning, and the processes of planning and design as they relate to the solution of problems in the natural and urban environment. The PhD degree is appropriate for students seeking careers in research and teaching in landscape architecture and environmental planning, or in specialized roles in government or professional consultation.</p>
<h3>Degree Requirements</h3>
<p>Students formulate coursework plans (to include the PhD seminar) to develop an individual specialization within the field, which must be approved by the students' program advisers. PhD requirements are as follows: 32 units of upper division and graduate coursework, a two-year academic residency, reading knowledge of a departmentally approved foreign language, successful completion of a qualifying examination, and a dissertation.</p>
<p>Progress toward the degree is evaluated at least annually by the PhD committee. By no later than the end of the third semester, students will be evaluated as to their suitability for completing the PhD degree. Any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, seems unlikely to be able to complete all degree requirements (including dissertation research) will be subject to dismissal.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Participation of faculty in research increases the base of knowledge and theory in support of teaching and the profession. PhD students are often involved in these research topics as research assistants. Current topics include natural resource analysis, computerized inventories, environmental impact studies, methods of shoreline classification, principles of forest landscape design, urban livability studies, urban perception, case studies in urban design, morphological studies of the urban edge, environmental interpretation, behavior in parks and open spaces, community recreation projects, and environmental simulation.</p>
<h3>Admissions Criteria</h3>
<p>Admission to the PhD program is granted to a small number of highly qualified individuals each year. Applicants should have completed a master's degree before entering. Students with only a bachelor's degree should apply to the MLA program first, or otherwise complete an appropriate master's degree before applying.</p>

				<a name="mastersdegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Master's Degree Requirements</h2><p>The Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning offers three Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) degree programs that are structured to equip students with advanced design and planning skills:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/programs/master-of-landscape-architecture/first-professional-degree">three-year MLA degree</a>
 is the first professional degree accredited by the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA). This degree is for students with non-design backgrounds.</li>

	<li>The <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/programs/master-of-landscape-architecture/second-professional-degree">two-year MLA degree</a>
 is the second professional degree, also accredited by ASLA, for those students with first degrees in landscape architecture, architecture, or environmental design.</li>

	<li>The department also offers a <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/programs/master-of-landscape-architecture/environmental-planning">two-year environmental planning program</a>
 leading to the MLA degree for students with a strong background in the environmental sciences or management.</li>

</ul>

<h4><strong>Degree Requirements</strong></h4>
<p>Students are required to select and complete one of two plans for the degree: Plan I—Thesis, or Plan II—Comprehensive Exam (professional project or designated studio.) The thesis is for students who wish to do original research on a problem in landscape architecture or environmental planning. The thesis committee is composed of two faculty members from the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning and a third faculty member from another department at Berkeley. The comprehensive exam format can be either a professional project or a designated studio that demonstrates broad competence plus the concepts and skills necessary to the field of landscape architecture. The professional project consists of a report of not more than 40 pages of text with appropriate professional drawings. It should document a real-world project. The professional project committee is composed of two faculty members from the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning and a third member from outside the University community who usually is affiliated with the project.</p>
<p>Students may elect to fulfill the final degree requirement through the successful completion of a comprehensive exam studio taken in their final semester. Students who are in the Environmental Planning Concentration or in one of the concurrent degree programs are not eligible for the comprehensive exam studio option.</p>
<p>In addition, a summer internship (preferably taken the summer before the student's final year) is recommended. Previous professional experience may be substituted for this internship.</p>
<p>Normative time for the MLA degree is either two years (design background and environmental planning students) or three years (non-design background). A student's normative time is determined when the student enters the MLA program.</p>
<h4><strong>Public Information Policy</strong></h4>
<p>Public Information Policy Programs accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB) are required to provice reliable information to the public. Programs must report on accreditation status and its performance. This information is to help potential students make informed application decisions.
