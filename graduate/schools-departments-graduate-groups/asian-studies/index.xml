<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Faculty Group in Asian Studies administers an interdisciplinary program leading to BA, MA, and PhD degrees. Utilizing the faculty and facilities of the entire university, these degree programs cut across conventional disciplinary lines and emphasize a basic core of knowledge concerning one particular geographic area of Asia. Within this core, which requires course work in multiple departments and reading knowledge of at least one Asian language, regionally-oriented students have the freedom to plan an individual program according to their particular interests and approaches. No two programs are alike, and students work closely with the Student Affairs office and with a faculty mentor in designing their customized academic plan. The Faculty Group also offers concurrent degree programs with the Schools of Journalism and Law as well as an undergraduate minor. The group is supported in its efforts by the <a href="http://ieas.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Institute of East Asian Studies</a>
, the <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">International and Area Studies Teaching Program</a>
 and the <a href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/?q=about-college/l-s-divisions/undergraduate-division/ugis" target="_blank">Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies of the College of Letters and Science.</a>
</p>

<p>UC Berkeley has long been noted for its outstanding scholarship in the area of Asian Studies. A faculty group and an interdisciplinary graduate program on Asia were first established in 1949 under the name Asiatic Studies. The name was changed to Asian Studies in 1959. An interdisciplinary undergraduate major in Asian Studies was established in 1975. More than 70 faculty members and 15 departments are presently engaged in teaching and research concerning Asia. These resources are supplemented by extensive library facilities and by the programs of five major area centers that offer lecture series and colloquia throughout the year. The Bay Area itself, with its Asian ethnic communities, museums, performing arts, monasteries, and trade centers, provides unlimited cultural opportunities for the student interested in reaching beyond the confines of the University.</p>
<p>With the oversight of the Graduate Division, the Group provides a terminal MA in Asian Studies.  In addition, the Group provides a MA/MJ concurrent degree with the School of Journalism, and an interdisciplinary PhD program (open only to UC Berkeley MA in Asian Studies graduates).</p>
<h3>Institute of East Asian Studies</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://ieas.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Institute of East Asian Studies</a>
, of which the Group in Asian Studies is a part, also supports other programs and affiliates related to areas of interest to students and faculty in Asian Studies. For further information, see the <a href="http://ieas.berkeley.edu/ccs/" target="_blank">Center for Chinese Studies</a>
, the <a href="http://ieas.berkeley.edu/cjs/" target="_blank">Center for Japanese Studies</a>

, and the <a href="http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Buddhist Studies</a>
.  Other campus centers of interest to students and faculty include the <a href="http://southasia.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for South Asia Studies</a>
 and the <a href="http://cseas.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Southeast Asia Studies</a>

<h3>Berkeley Student Journal of Asian Studies</h3>
<p>The <em>Berkeley Student Journal of Asian Studies</em> is an interdisciplinary student journal that bridges research at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The <em>Journal </em>strives to broaden the study of Asia across disciplinary lines and to expand the Asian Studies community by promoting leadership and scholarship of Asia. For further information, please click <a href="http://ieas.berkeley.edu/gas/sjas/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>

<h3>Undergraduate Program</h3>
<p>The undergraduate group major in Asian studies is a rigorous but flexible interdisciplinary program designed to assist students in taking advantage of the rich course offerings in the Asian field campus-wide in a way that is not available through individual departments. There are three concentrations from which a student may select in the major: (1) a multi-area thematic concentration (2) a concentration on China (3) a concentration on Japan. &quot;Multi-area&quot; includes all countries and regions of Asia. One of the areas chosen must be either China or Japan. Other areas can include Korea and countries in South Asia or Southeast Asia.  The Group in Asian Studies offers three minors: Chinese Studies, Japanese Studies, Korean Studies.</p>
<p>The undergraduate program is one of six majors under the <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">International and Area Studies Teaching Program</a>
