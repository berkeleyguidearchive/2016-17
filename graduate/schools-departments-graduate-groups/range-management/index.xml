<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>An interdepartmental group of faculty members, from the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM) and related departments at UC Berkeley, administers the Range Management Masters program. The program prepares students with a bachelor's degree in resource management or related disciplines to pursue advanced work. Graduate study leads to a Master of Science degree that serves as the basis for a professional career in rangeland management. Fields of specialization include grassland, savanna, and shrubland ecology, rangeland rehabilitation, wetland ecology, and rangeland policy.</p>
<p><span>Doctoral work in range management may be pursued as part of the PhD program in ESPM.</span></p>
<h3><span>Undergraduate Program</span></h3>
