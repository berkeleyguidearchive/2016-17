<div>
<p><span>It is important that you carefully consider the total financing of your education, from your opening term at UC Berkeley to completing your degree. If financial help will be needed beyond the funds that you or your family are able to provide, you should make the necessary applications for financial assistance well in advance of enrollment. </span></p>
<p><span>You should pay particular attention to early deadlines for application for grants, scholarships, Federal Work-Study, Federal Perkins, and Federal Direct Loans. While the needs and resources of each student differ, the University can provide a general list of tuition and fees and expenses normally encountered. </span></p>
<p><strong><span><em>Note:</em> Fees are subject to change without notice.</span></strong></p>
</div>




<div>
<p>Part of your tuition and fees may be refunded if you cancel your registration before the first day of instruction or withdraw before the beginning of the sixth week of classes of any semester. <span id="docs-internal-guid-af099cdb-fd9f-993c-3568-921e1d0b9534">If you are enrolled in classes and/or paid fees, and you do not plan on attending that term, you must take action; for more details, see the</span> <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/registration/cancellation-withdrawal" target="_blank">Registrar's website.</a>
 </p>

<p>Please note that the cost of attending the University varies according to individual circumstances. The expenses listed in this Guide are approximate costs for the nine-month academic year and should be used only as a guideline.</p>
<p>Please refer to the tabbed information on this page, or <a href="http://financialaid.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">visit the Financial Aid website for more information</a>

				<a name="tuitionfeestext"></a><h2>Tuition &amp; Fees</h2><h3>Required Tuition and Fees</h3>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/feesched.html" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar’s website</a>
 for current fee information. <strong>All tuition and fees are subject to change.</strong></p>

<p><em>Note:</em> In November 2010, the Regents approved changing the name of the Educational Fee to “Tuition;” the name of Fee for Selected Professional School Students to “Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition;&quot; and the name of Nonresident Tuition to “Nonresident Supplemental Tuition,” effective July 1, 2011.</p>
<h4>Student Services Fee</h4>
<p>This fee (formerly referred to as the University Registration Fee) is paid by all students and shall be used to support services and programs that directly benefit students and that are complementary to, but not a part of, the core instructional program. These services and programs include, but are not limited to, operating and capital expenses for services related to the physical and psychological health and well-being of students; social, recreational, and cultural activities and programs; services related to campus life and campus community; technology expenses directly related to the services; and career support. These services and programs create a supportive and enriched learning environment for University of California students.</p>
<h4>Tuition (formerly Educational Fee)</h4>
<p>Tuition is used to support a portion of the student services costs of the educational program, such as financial aid, social and cultural activities, admissions and registrar operations, counseling and career guidance, student affirmative action, and academic tutoring. In exceptional circumstances, tuition may be reduced by one-half for part-time undergraduate students. Approval of part-time undergraduate study is made only in exceptional cases and is based on considerations of occupation, family responsibility, and health. Applications must be approved by the appropriate dean before the start of each term. A tuition reduction will be made only if you enroll in no more than two courses.</p>
<h4>Berkeley Campus Fee</h4>
<p>This fee provides support for a wide range of activities sponsored by the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC), including work with academic and administrative units of the campus. It covers use of the Student Union, helps pay construction costs of the new Student Union building and the Lower Sproul Project, and assists with the provision of ethnic studies on the Berkeley campus.</p>
<h4>Class Pass Transit Fee</h4>
<p>This fee, required of all students, gives students unlimited transportation on the local bus system (AC Transit).</p>
<h4>UC Berkeley Extension Fee</h4>
<p>Students enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extension Fall Program for Freshmen are assessed fees through UC Berkeley Extension. For information, call 510-643-0379.</p>
<h4>Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition (formerly Professional Degree Fee)</h4>
<p>Graduate students in the professional schools (Optometry, Business, Law, Public Health, Public Policy, Social Welfare, Information Management, Developmental Practice, Product Development, Translational Medicine and various programs in the Colleges of Environmental Design and Engineering) and the Health and Medical Sciences Joint Medical Program pay additional professional degree supplemental tuition. These amounts are available on the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/tuition-fees/fee-schedule" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar's website</a>
 and from the individual schools and programs.</p>

<h4>University Health Insurance Fee</h4>
<p>All students attending Berkeley must be covered by major medical health insurance. All students are therefore automatically enrolled in the University’s Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), which provides for specialized care and hospitalization and supplements campus care services provided by University Health Services (UHS) at the Tang Center. The cost for the plan is billed with tuition and registration fees each semester. Payment for both the fall and spring semesters provides major medical coverage for the entire calendar year, including summer. You may waive out of the University’s plan and not pay the fee if you can show proof of coverage comparable to the University’s plan. For more information, call 510-642-2000 or visit the <a href="http://uhs.berkeley.edu/ship" target="_blank">UHS website</a>
.</p>

<h4>Nonresident Supplemental Tuition</h4>
<p>At the time of registration, students are classified as a resident or nonresident for tuition and fee purposes. Only US citizens and holders of immigrant visas can qualify for resident classification. Under California law you may be classified as a resident for tuition and fee purposes if you have lived in California for more than one year immediately before the day instruction begins at the last of the campuses to open for a semester. Residency is the combination of physical presence within California, intent to live in California permanently, plus demonstrated financial independence for the two years immediately preceding the request for residence classification. Nonresidents must pay nonresident supplemental tuition each semester. For detailed information regarding the establishment of California residence, please see the <a href="/archive/2016-17/registration-enrollment/#residencyfortuitionpurposestext">California Residency section of this Guide</a>
; or write to the Legal Analyst, Residence Matters, 1111 Franklin Street, 8th Floor, Oakland, CA 94607-5200.</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Additional Fees and Expenses</h3>
<h4>Document Management Fee</h4>
<p>New students are assessed a Document Management Fee which covers various transactions fees for documents and services, including official transcripts, verification of enrollments and degrees, certificates of completion, and one-time mailing of diplomas, for the lifetime of the degree.</p>
<h4>Late Registration Fee</h4>
<p>A $150 late registration fee will be charged to all students who fail to become officially registered by the end of the third week of instruction each semester. To be officially registered, a student must be enrolled in at least one course; pay at least 20% of assessed tuition and registration fees; and have no active registration blocks.</p>
<h4>Late Fee Payment</h4>
<p>Payments must be received, not postmarked, by the deadline indicated on <a href="https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">CalCentral</a>
. All other delinquent accounts more than $50 will be assessed penalties as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$20 on accounts one month past due</li>
	<li>$25 on accounts two months past due and monthly thereafter until the account is brought current.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Returned Check Charges</span></h4>
<p>A processing charge of $50 is assessed when the bank returns a check for payment of tuition and registration fees. A processing charge of $20 is assessed for all other returned checks.</p>
<h4>Reinstatement after Having Been Dropped from University Rolls</h4>
<p>$10</p>
<h4>Collection Costs</h4>
<p>Additional costs may be assessed on any defaulted debts requiring remedial collection activity. These costs may include applicable attorney’s fees.</p>
<h4>Cal Intercollegiate Athletics</h4>
<p>Student <a href="http://www.calbears.com/" target="_blank">season tickets</a>
 are available for purchase for football and men’s basketball, while supplies last. Admission to other regular season home events is free to all currently registered full-time Berkeley students with student ID.</p>

<h3>Fellowships, Graduate Scholarships, and Academic Appointments for Graduate Students</h3>
<p>Numerous programs—from fellowships, grants-in-aid, and loans to assistantships, subsidized housing, and child care programs—can help students reduce the costs of graduate school. Some programs are need-based and are administered through the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office. Others are merit-based and are administered through the Graduate Fellowships Office and the academic departments. For detailed information, consult the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/index.shtml" target="_blank">Graduate Application for Admission and Fellowships</a>
 or the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/financial/fellowships/" target="_blank">Graduate Fellowships Office</a>
.</p>

<h4>Fellowships and Graduate Scholarships</h4>
<p>Applications for University fellowships and graduate scholarships are considered only once a year as part of the admission process. Awards are made for the academic year beginning with the fall semester. U.S. citizens and permanent residents should complete the “Free Application for Federal Student Aid” (FAFSA) for determination of financial need.</p>
<h4>Fellowship Application Procedure</h4>
<p>Students applying for admission/fellowship, must file the combined <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/index.shtml" target="_blank">Graduate Application for Admission and Fellowships</a>
, according to instructions included in the application. </p>

<p>Students applying for admission for the spring semester must contact the academic department.</p>
<p>Continuing or returning graduate students at Berkeley may obtain the necessary fellowship application materials from the department or graduate group. For a list of funding opportunities throughout the year, visit the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/financial/deadlines.shtml" target="_blank">Graduate Fellowships website</a>
.</p>

<p>The fellowship application deadlines for new students range from early December to late January, depending on the department; see the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/index.shtml" target="_blank">Graduate Application for Admission and Fellowships</a>
 for deadlines. Continuing students should consult their departments about departmental funding application processes and deadlines.</p>

<h4>Announcement of Awards</h4>
<p>University Awards are announced by March 1 and must be accepted or declined, in writing, by April 15.</p>
<h4>Fellowship Supplementation</h4>
<p>Fellows receiving stipends of $16,000 plus payment of fees (the latter from either fellowship or academic appointments) may be subject to an employment restriction: students may work up to 25 percent during the academic year (25 percent each term or 50 percent for one term only). There is no work restriction for the Summer term. Fellowship opportunities are announced monthly in <em>GradNews</em>, the online newsletter of the Graduate Division. All continuing graduate students receive <em>GradNews</em> each month; others may sign up for <em>GradNews</em> by sending an email to <a href="mailto:gradpub@berkeley.edu">gradpub@berkeley.edu</a>
 with  &quot;<em>GradNews</em> mailing list&quot; in the subject line.</p>

<h4>Graduate Diversity Program (GDP)</h4>
<p>The Graduate Diversity Program provides active support to students historically underrepresented in graduate education, through a number of services:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Outreach visits throughout the country</li>
	<li>Academic advising/mentoring throughout the student’s academic career</li>
	<li>Undergraduate research opportunities</li>
	<li>Advice on applying to graduate school</li>
	<li>Monthly seminars on professional development</li>
	<li>Career advice/planning</li>
	<li>Networking opportunities on campus</li>
</ul>
<p>Underrepresented students will find social and academic support in numerous student organizations on campus, such as those listed on the <a href="http://ga.berkeley.edu/projects/gmsp" target="_blank">Graduate Minority Students’ Project website</a>
. In addition, the University maintains discipline-based student diversity programs in engineering, the humanities, public health, and the biological, physical, and social sciences. For information regarding opportunities and support on behalf of diversity, contact the Graduate Diversity Program, 327 Sproul, #5900; 510-642-7294 or see <a href="http://diversity.berkeley.edu/graduate/gdp" target="_blank">grad.diversity@berkeley.edu</a>
.</p>

<h4>Graduate Student Academic Appointments</h4>
<p>Academic appointments are an important source of financial support and pedagogical development for Berkeley graduate students. Their availability varies from department to department. As part of an offer of admission, departments may propose a combination of teaching and research appointments as part of a financial support package. Other departments may expect graduate students to arrange for appointments once they have been admitted. Some departments have a teaching requirement as part of their academic program. Admitted students should clarify with their departments opportunities and obligations regarding academic appointments.</p>
<p>Graduate students appointed by the University to most academic titles must meet minimum academic requirements, such as a minimum GPA and a limit on incomplete grades, and be registered and enrolled in at least 12 units of 100- to 200-level courses per semester until they are advanced to doctoral candidacy. Units in the 600 series may be substituted for 200-level units when appropriate. Lower division units taken to prepare for departmental requirements (languages, mathematics, statistics) may be substituted for 100-level units. Most graduate student academic appointments are eligible for tuition and fee remissions in addition to a salary. For more information on eligibility requirements and the availability of appointments, students should contact the department for which they wish to work.</p>
<p>Graduate students are restricted to working no more than half time regardless of the positions they hold. To ensure proper academic progress, the University may not appoint candidates for higher degrees in any capacity at more than half time during the academic year without the express consent of the Dean of the Graduate Division. Summer appointments may be full time.</p>
<p>Graduate student instructors (GSIs), acting instructors (AI-GS), readers, tutors, nursery school assistants, and community teaching fellows are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Automobile Workers (UAW). Under the language of the contract, students hired in those titles are referred to as ASEs (academic student employees), an acronym used in the contract and in some campus communications. ASEs should familiarize themselves with the contract; see the <a href="http://hrweb.berkeley.edu/labor/contracts/BX" target="_blank">Labor Relations website</a>
. Information on anticipated appointments for the next academic year can be found on the <a href="http://hrweb.berkeley.edu/labor/contracts/BX/job-opportunities/expected" target="_blank">Labor Relations website</a>
.</p>

<h4>Teaching Appointments</h4>
<p>Many departments make GSI positions available to qualified graduate students. GSIs must be registered full-time students and are limited to working half-time or less. They are chosen for scholarly achievement and promise as teachers, and they serve under active supervision of the regular faculty. Some departments require their students to complete a specified minimum period of teaching as part of their PhD programs.</p>
<p>Graduate students who do not speak English as a native language and do not hold a bachelor’s degree from an institution in the United States must pass a test of spoken English before they can be appointed as graduate student instructors. For students who have taken the <a href="http://www.ets.org/toefl" target="_blank">Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)</a>
 Internet-Based Test (iBT), the speaking section score will be used to determine proficiency. Students who have not taken the TOEFL iBT, and who need to demonstrate oral English proficiency, should take the Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit (SPEAK) at Berkeley.</p>

<p>For further information on the Language Proficiency Program (testing and courses), visit the <a href="http://gsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">GSI Teaching and Resource Center website. </a>
</p>

<h4>Research Appointments</h4>
<p>Qualified registered full-time graduate students may seek a research appointment in the departments, centers, and institutes of the University. Graduate student researchers (GSRs) perform research broadly related to their degree programs in an academic department or research unit under the direction of a faculty member or authorized principal investigator. The duration and extent of such an appointment may vary. Students should apply directly to the department, center, or institute in which they wish to work.</p>
<h4>Stipends and Tuition and Fee Remissions</h4>
<p>Stipends are subject to U.S. income tax deductions. For teaching appointments, salary is typically paid in five equal installments per semester. Since payment for work performed is later than the deadline for payment of tuition and registration fees, students should obtain information about payment schedules and deadlines.</p>
<p>Some appointments carry a benefit called a tuition and fee remission, which offsets either a portion or all of your assessed tuition and fees. Student should check with their department to determine specific eligibility, and review the basic requirements in the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/financial/fee-remissions/" target="_blank">Fee Remission Bulletin.</a>
</p>

<p>More information about being a graduate student instructor, graduate student researcher, reader, or tutor is available from the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/policies/guides/category/appointments-guide/" target="_blank">Graduate Services: Appointments Guide</a>

				<a name="undergraduatebudgetstext"></a><h2>Student Budgets</h2><h3>Undergraduate Student Budgets 2016-17</h3>
<p>Your budget is the estimated average and reasonable cost of completing an academic year at UC Berkeley. Your budget serves as the foundation for determining your financial need as well as the amount of qualified aid that can be offered to you. Cost-of-attendance figures are established through student surveys and other research and may include the following components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tuition and fees (assuming full-time attendance)</li>
	<li><span class="check">Books and supplies</span></li>
	<li><span class="check"><span class="check">Room and board</span></span></li>

</span>
</li>

</ul>

<p>Certain programs do not include all of the items listed. If you are attending an online program at UC Berkeley, your budget may not include certain items such as health insurance, living expenses, transportation, and personal costs.</p>
<p>The Financial Aid and Scholarships Office may adjust the cost of attendance for students on a case-by-case basis to address individual circumstances.</p>
<p>The Student Budget is subject to change. These amounts are the most recent estimates available as of March 17, 2016.</p>
<p><em>Please note: UC Berkeley reserves the right to adjust awards to correct any awarding errors. Changes to qualifying information or revisions of federal, state, or institutional policy may result in updates to aid eligibility and adjustments of financial aid awards.

<p>Students in a number of professional degree programs will pay additional tuition and fees based on their school or department, or degree program. Check with your school or department for more information about their Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition (PDST). Students in the Schools of Law, Optometry, Public Policy, Public Health, Social Welfare, Information Management, and various programs in the College of Environmental Design, the Engineering Master's Program, the MBA programs in the Haas School of Business, and the Joint Medical Program are subject to different tuition and fee schedules. Nonresidents of California in the professional degree programs will pay nonresident supplemental tuition and fees of $12,246 or $13,674 (depending on your program), not the amount shown in the chart above. All fee schedules are available here. Concurrent degree students, or academic degree students with a second degree goal from a professional degree program will have a pro-rated professional degree supplemental tuition amount, based on their two programs.</p>
